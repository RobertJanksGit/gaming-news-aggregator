Key Points
It seems likely that you can build a Node.js app to scrape video game news from the day of, filter interesting stories with OpenAI, and summarize them with catchy titles.
Research suggests using RSS feeds for scraping, OpenAI for filtering and summarizing, and readability libraries for full text extraction.
The evidence leans toward handling this with libraries like rss-parser, openai, and @mozilla/readability, ensuring proper error handling and API limits.
Setup and Scraping
To start, you'll need to set up your Node.js environment and install necessary libraries. Use rss-parser to scrape feeds from sites like IGN (rss-parser npm) and filter for today's articles by comparing publication dates. This approach is efficient and avoids complex web scraping issues.
Filtering with OpenAI
Send the list of article titles, summaries, and URLs to OpenAI using the openai library (OpenAI Node.js GitHub). Craft a prompt to select the top N interesting articles, asking for the response in JSON format for easy parsing. This step relies on OpenAI's text generation capabilities to rank by interest.
Summarizing and Titling
For each selected article, use @mozilla/readability with jsdom to extract full text (@mozilla/readability npm). Then, send the text to OpenAI with a prompt to summarize and create a catchy title, ensuring the summary references the source and returns in JSON format.
Survey Note: Detailed Implementation Guide for Video Game News App
This section provides a comprehensive guide for building a Node.js application that scrapes video game news from the latest day, filters interesting stories using OpenAI, and summarizes them with catchy titles, referencing sources. The process involves multiple steps, each with specific tools and considerations, ensuring robustness and efficiency.
Background and Approach
The task involves creating an application that first gathers video game news articles published on the current day, filters them for interest using OpenAI, and then summarizes the selected articles, creating catchy titles while referencing the original sources. Given the current date is February 24, 2025, the app must focus on today's news. The approach leverages RSS feeds for initial data collection, OpenAI for AI-driven filtering and summarization, and readability libraries for extracting full article text, aligning with best practices for web scraping and API integration.
Step 1: Setting Up and Scraping RSS Feeds
To begin, install the required Node.js libraries:
rss-parser for parsing RSS feeds (rss-parser npm).
openai for interacting with OpenAI API (OpenAI Node.js GitHub).
@mozilla/readability and jsdom for article text extraction (@mozilla/readability npm).
Define a list of RSS feeds from video game news sites, such as:
IGN: https://www.ign.com/rss/all
GameSpot: https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/allnews
Polygon: https://www.polygon.com/rss/index.xml
Kotaku: https://kotaku.com/rss
Use rss-parser to fetch and parse these feeds, filtering for articles published on February 24, 2025. This involves comparing the pubDate field with the current date, ensuring articles fall within the day's range (00:00 to 23:59:59). Here's a sample implementation:
javascript
const Parser = require('rss-parser');
const parser = new Parser();

async function getLatestArticles() {
  const rssFeeds = [
    'https://www.ign.com/rss/all',
    'https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/allnews',
    'https://www.polygon.com/rss/index.xml',
    'https://kotaku.com/rss',
  ];
  const allArticles = [];

  for (const feedUrl of rssFeeds) {
    try {
      const feed = await parser.parseURL(feedUrl);
      const currentDate = new Date();
      const startOfDay = new Date(currentDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0));
      const endOfDay = new Date(currentDate.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999));

      const filteredArticles = feed.items
        .filter(item => {
          const pubDate = new Date(item.pubDate);
          return pubDate >= startOfDay && pubDate <= endOfDay;
        });

      allArticles.push(...filteredArticles);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(`Error parsing RSS feed from ${feedUrl}:`, err);
    }
  }

  // Remove duplicates by URL
  const uniqueArticles = Array.from(new Set(allArticles.map(item => item.link)))
    .map(url => allArticles.find(item => item.link === url));

  return uniqueArticles;
}
This code handles multiple feeds, filters by date, and removes duplicates, ensuring a clean list of articles for further processing.
Step 2: Filtering Interesting Articles with OpenAI
Next, send the list of articles (titles, summaries, and URLs) to OpenAI for filtering. Set up the OpenAI client with your API key, stored as an environment variable for security:
javascript
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require('openai');
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
Craft a prompt to select, say, the top 5 most interesting articles, requesting the response in JSON format for easy parsing. The prompt should look like:
javascript
async function filterArticles(articles, numToSelect) {
  const articleList = articles
    .map(article => `Title: ${article.title}\nSummary: ${article.description}\nURL: ${article.link}`)
    .join('\n\n');

  const prompt = `You are given a list of video game news articles. Each article has a title, summary, and URL. Please select the top ${numToSelect} most interesting articles from this list and return their titles and URLs in JSON format as an array of objects, each object containing 'title' and 'url' properties.

List of articles:

${articleList}

`;

  const response = await openai.createCompletion({
    model: 'text-davinci-003',
    prompt,
    max_tokens: 1000,
    temperature: 0.5,
  });

  const selectedArticlesStr = response.data.choices[0].text;
  try {
    const selectedArticles = JSON.parse(selectedArticlesStr);
    return selectedArticles;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error parsing JSON from OpenAi response:', err);
    return [];
  }
}
This approach uses OpenAI's text generation to rank articles by interest, returning a structured JSON response for further processing.
Step 3: Extracting Full Article Text
For each selected article, extract the full text using @mozilla/readability with jsdom. This requires installing node-fetch for HTTP requests:
bash
npm install node-fetch
The implementation is as follows:
javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function getArticleText(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const html = await response.text();
    const dom = new JSDOM(html, { url });
    const reader = new Readability(dom.window, url);
    await reader.parse();
    return reader.content;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error scraping article from ${url}:`, err);
    return null;
  }
}
This function handles potential errors, such as network issues or pages with complex structures, logging errors and returning null for failed extractions.
Step 4: Summarizing Articles and Creating Catchy Titles
Finally, send the full text of each selected article to OpenAI for summarization and titling. The prompt should instruct the AI to summarize as if discussing the article, reference the source, and create a catchy title, returning in JSON format:
javascript
async function summarizeArticle(fullText, url) {
  const prompt = `Summarize the following article and create a catchy title for the summary. The summary should be written as if you're discussing the article and should include a reference to the original source. The original source is ${url}.

Article:

${fullText}

Please return the summary and the title in the following JSON format:

{
  "title": "Catchy Title",
  "summary": "Summary text"
}

`;

  const response = await openai.createCompletion({
    model: 'text-davinci-003',
    prompt,
    max_tokens: 1000,
    temperature: 0.5,
  });

  const summaryStr = response.data.choices[0].text;
  try {
    const summary = JSON.parse(summaryStr);
    return summary;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error parsing JSON from OpenAi response:', err);
    return null;
  }
}
This ensures the summary is conversational, references the source, and includes a catchy title, meeting the user's requirements.
Considerations and Best Practices
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for RSS parsing, OpenAI API calls, and text extraction, logging errors for debugging.
API Limits: Be mindful of OpenAI's rate limits and token constraints, especially with long articles. Consider batching requests or truncating text if necessary.
Website Variability: Some sites may have paywalls or complex structures, potentially affecting readability extraction. Test with multiple sources and consider custom scrapers for problematic sites.
Scheduling: For daily news, consider using node-cron to schedule the app to run at a specific time each day, ensuring fresh content.
Sample Workflow
The main function orchestrates the process:
javascript
async function main() {
  const articles = await getLatestArticles();
  const numToSelect = 5;
  const selectedArticles = await filterArticles(articles, numToSelect);

  for (const article of selectedArticles) {
    const fullText = await getArticleText(article.url);
    if (fullText) {
      const summary = await summarizeArticle(fullText, article.url);
      console.log(`Title: ${summary.title}\nSummary: ${summary.summary}\nSource: ${article.url}\n\n`);
    }
  }
}

main();
This workflow ensures a seamless flow from scraping to summarization, with outputs logged for review.
